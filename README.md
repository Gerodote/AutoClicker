# AutoClicker
My first attempt using threads.
Accidently, it's an autoclicker for Windows. In code you can change what you would like to auto "click". For instance, there's commented a code for autoclick space-key.
You can set autoclicker's period in ms using console.
Without changing the code, you can 'autoclick' left mouse button.
