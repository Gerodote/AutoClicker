# AutoClicker
My first attempt using threads.
Accidently, it's an autoclicker for Windows. In code you can change what you would like to auto "click". For instance, there's commented a code for autoclick space-key.
You can set autoclicker's period in ms using console.
Without changing the code, you can 'autoclick' left mouse button.

At my PC this programm consume almost nothing, so it's strangely optimized.![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58738099/136944093-6d1fc874-19a6-4a84-a95e-d572dd4f9234.png)
